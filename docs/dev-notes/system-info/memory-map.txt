The cache uses address bits 31..29 to specify its behavior:

   000    0x0-------..0x1-------   Cache area                      Cache used when CCR.CE=1
   001    0x2-------..0x3-------   Cache-through area              Cache bypassed
   010    0x4-------..0x5-------   Associative purge area          Purge accessed cache lines (reads return 0x2312)
   011    0x6-------..0x7-------   Address array read/write area   Cache addresses acessed directly (1 KiB, mirrored)
   100    0x8-------..0x9-------   [undocumented, same as 110]
   101    0xA-------..0xB-------   [undocumented, same as 001]
   110    0xC-------..0xD-------   Data array read/write area      Cache data acessed directly (4 KiB, mirrored)

Address bits 28 and 27 are disconnected, thus the usable address space is 128 MiB.

Notes
- With the exception of VDP1 registers, all regions are mirrored across the designated area
- The region just above Work RAM Low varies based on system revision:
  - VA0/VA1: open bus - writes are ignored, reads return all FFs
  - VA2: read/write mirror of Work RAM Low
  - VA3: unknown
- Backup RAM
  - Only odd bytes mapped
  - Reads from even bytes return 0xFF
  - Writes to even bytes map to corresponding odd byte

Interconnections:
- Both SH-2s have access to SCU, SMPC, 2 MiB WRAM and 512 KiB IPL ROM
- SCU has access to VDP1, VDP2, SCSP, CD Block and the cartridge interface
- SMPC has access to peripherals (gamepads)
- VDP1 has 1 MiB RAM (2x 256 KiB framebuffers + 512 KiB VRAM)
- VDP2 has 516 KiB RAM (4x 128 KiB VRAM banks A0 A1 B0 B1 + 4 KiB color RAM)
- SCSP contains the MC68EC000 and 512 KiB of sound RAM
- MC68EC000 can only access the SCSP and the 512 KiB of sound RAM
