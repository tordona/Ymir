==========================================================
Games that use mismatching VDP1 and VDP2 sprite data sizes
==========================================================

VDP1 has a flag to draw sprites using 8-bit or 16-bit data.
VDP2 has a setting to select the sprite data format from 16 options, half of which are 8 bits and half 16 bits.
The sprite data sizes are supposed to match, but some games misbehave and set them up incorrectly.

Sega Ages - I Love Mickey Mouse - Fushigi no Oshiro Daibouken & I Love Donald Duck - Georgia Ou no Hihou
  Both games set up VDP1 to render sprites with 16-bit data and VDP2 to use sprite data type 8 (an 8-bit format).
